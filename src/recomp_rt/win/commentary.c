/* Faster commentary (#31): a sixth commentary speed, "Fastest", twice as fast as Very Fast.
 *
 * The speed is a percentage of each line's delay: Very Fast 20, Fast 55, Medium 90, Slow 125,
 * Very Slow 150. The human manager record keeps it (+0x9ad2, getter 0x5fcff0, setter 0x5fd100) and the
 * match screen build copies it into the match (byte +0x2db0, 0x719c4e). The line delay is
 * line_delay * speed / 100 (0x6d8bc7 in 0x6d7b00). The match input 0x71a240 stores the data of any item
 * with action id 0xc, so an item with data 10 needs no input code.
 * See docs/research/2026-10-15-commentary-speed-inventory.md.
 *
 * The runtime adds the item "Fastest" (data 10) above Very Fast in the speed popup. The original skips
 * an extra pause after special events only at Very Fast (0x6b5686 in the commentary step 0x6b55c0), so
 * during that step the match shows 20, and during a line's delay (0x6d7b00) 10 again.
 *
 * In the original the speed already changes how often other matches of the day step while a line
 * waits, so the match result depends on the speed at every speed. Fastest does the same, no more. */
