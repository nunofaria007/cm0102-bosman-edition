"""Picker check: the Assistant's picks from a saved game against the best possible assignment.

Usage:
    python3 tests/smoke/picker_check.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> <save> [--dir <fixtures folder>]
        [--expect SLOT=Name]... [--never SLOT=Name]... [--keep <file>]

The run copies the save (from the fixtures folder, tests/fixtures/fixtures.py) into a new empty user folder
and loads it. At the first human turn the runtime (RECOMP_PICK_CHECK, src/recomp_rt/win/picker.c) computes
the three picks (best, most match-fit, under-21) of the player's club without writing them, dumps the
candidates, the value of each candidate in each slot and the picks, then runs "Pick best team" and ends.

Checks for each pick:
    - the eleven and the subs have the best total of all assignments. The order of a total: fewest empty
      slots, then fewest players with a fit below 10, then fewest players from outside the pick's first
      group (kinds 2 and 3, Q142), then the highest score. This script finds the best total by its own method (a
      search over the slots taken), not the runtime's.
    - each fit and score equals this script's own sum from the dumped ratings and shown attributes. The
      score (Q138, Q139) is the average of the key shown attributes of the slot's position (KEYS) times
      fit / 20. The dump holds it as the sum of the key attributes x fit x 60 / their count, an integer;
      the table shows it divided by 1200.
    - no player with a fit below 10 plays while a free player, of any group, has 10 or more there (Q142)
    - no player is picked twice, and the subs come from the players left over
    - --expect DR=Warner: a slot of that label holds the player (full name or surname); --never: no such
      slot does. SAVE_CHECKS adds the checks of yeovil.sav and start.sav.
    - SAVE_ATTRS: one player's shown attributes, against a wrong attribute index in the runtime
--keep copies the dump to a file. It has one "cand" line per candidate: name, the position ratings, the 31
shown attributes, current ability, age, condition, first group, then the fit and the value of each slot.

Examples (the Yeovil save is a copy of Max's game; never use his own save):
    picker_check.py build/cm0102_recomp ../clean-3968 yeovil.sav
    picker_check.py build/cm0102_recomp ../clean-3968 start.sav
